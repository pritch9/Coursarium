# Coursarium

Coursarium is the leading solution to course websites.   Traditional course websites are either powered by archaic platforms, or handmade by professors themselves.  

Coursarium is designed to eliminate the tedious efforts required to create course websites by providing an intuitive user-interface, paired with a strong communication interface to maximize teacher-student interactions.
